# Post-Selection Shrinkage Estimator Using High-Dimensional Data 

We have developed and implemented a post-selection shrinkage estimation strategy that can be summarized as follows:

(1) regularization method to select a subset model, 
(2) based on the selected submodel, construct a weighted elastic net estimator, 
(3) obtain a post-selection shrinkage estimator by shrinking the post-selection weighted elastic net estimator in the direction of the restricted estimator (RE).
